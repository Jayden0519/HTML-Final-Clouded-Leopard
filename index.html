	 Clouded leopards get their names as they are commonly known for living in the cloud forests in Southeast Asia and have been around for hundreds of thousands of years however, they aren't small enough to be housecat size but definitely not large enough to be part of a true big cat family. Male Leopards weight around 50 pounds where females usuually weight less at around 30 pounds. They also cant roar or purr! Clouded Leopards are carnivores and their main source of food consists of wild boars, gibbons, small deer, and macaques. Often they will eat rodents and other small animals primarly pouncing on their pray due their shart strong build and large gape able to spread over 100 degrees, their textured beige and black pattern allows them to blend in with trees during the day but Clouded leopards are primarily nocturnal hunters. Underneath is a video about Clouded Leopard cubs that became orphans. They were sucessfully raised and released into the wild.
