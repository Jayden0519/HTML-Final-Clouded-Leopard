	 Clouded leopards are currently in the endangered status. Their forest habitat is experiencing the world's fastest rates of deforestation. Constant habitat distruction for natural recources has caused a lack of food for these animals, and illegal poaching for their fur, and teeth all account for the declining Clouded leopard population.

              <br><br> I know that I needed to write a very well written, formulated letter and after ages of being on W3 school I was truly struggling but this is finally coming together. It is currently 9/17/2022, 10:13pm I was procrastinating and I do regret it but hey im being productive and im making this website look real good.  
              <br><br><strong><big>Clouded Leopard Analysis</big></strong>
              <br><br>This website is a clouded leopard appreciation page because it was the very first topic I made my first HTML website about in the 7th grade with my old teacher Ms.D. 
            </p>  

              <br><br><br>Its Hispanic heritige month according to this websites client call!!!!
